create a python GameLogic class that includes a static method called calculate_score
Certainly, here is an example implementation of a GameLogic class in Python that includes a static method called calculate_score:

python
Copy code
class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        """
        Calculate the score based on the given list of dice.

        Args:
            dice (list[int]): A list of integers representing the values of the dice.

        Returns:
            int: The total score for the given dice.
        """
        score = 0

        # Handle the case where the dice list is empty.
        if not dice:
            return score

        # Check for three-of-a-kind or higher.
        for value in set(dice):
            if dice.count(value) >= 3:
                if value == 1:
                    score += 1000
                else:
                    score += value * 100
                for i in range(3):
                    dice.remove(value)

        # Add any remaining 1s or 5s.
        for value in dice:
            if value == 1:
                score += 100
            elif value == 5:
                score += 50

        return score
In this implementation, the calculate_score method takes a list of integers representing the values of the dice, and returns the total score for those dice according to the rules of a game like Farkle. The method uses a simple algorithm to determine the score:

Check for three-of-a-kind or higher. For each value that appears three or more times in the dice list, add the appropriate score to the total and remove those dice from the list.
Add any remaining 1s or 5s to the total score.
Note that the calculate_score method is defined as a static method using the @staticmethod decorator, which means it can be called directly on the GameLogic class without needing an instance of the class.

If four, five, or six of a kind are rolled, each additional dice doubles the amount of dice previously rolled. For example, 4 die showing the number 3 would be 600 points and 5 die showing the number 3 would be 1200 points
Great, here is an updated implementation of the calculate_score method that takes into account the rule you mentioned:

python
Copy code
class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        """
        Calculate the score based on the given list of dice.

        Args:
            dice (list[int]): A list of integers representing the values of the dice.

        Returns:
            int: The total score for the given dice.
        """
        score = 0

        # Handle the case where the dice list is empty.
        if not dice:
            return score

        # Check for three-of-a-kind or higher.
        for value in set(dice):
            count = dice.count(value)
            if count >= 3:
                if value == 1:
                    score += 1000 if count == 3 else 1000 + (count - 3) * 100
                elif value == 5:
                    score += 500 if count == 3 else 500 + (count - 3) * 50
                else:
                    score += value * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3))
                for i in range(3):
                    dice.remove(value)

        # Add any remaining 1s or 5s.
        for value in dice:
            if value == 1:
                score += 100
            elif value == 5:
                score += 50

        return score
In this implementation, the calculate_score method now checks for four, five, or six of a kind and calculates the score accordingly. If a value appears four, five, or six times in the dice list, each additional dice doubles the amount of dice previously rolled. For example, if there are five dice showing the number 3, the score is 1200 points (i.e., 600 points for the first four dice, and then 600 more points for the fifth die). Note that this implementation assumes that only one value can be scored as four, five, or six of a kind in a single roll.

A straight from 1 to 6 is worth 1500 points. If a player fails to roll a straight, they may make one attempt to complete the straight. If the desired number(s) does not turn up on the next roll, that round is a "crap out" even if there are scoring dice on the table i.e. 1's or 5's.
Thank you for the additional rule. Here is an updated implementation of the calculate_score method that includes the straight and the one attempt to complete it:

python
Copy code
class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        """
        Calculate the score based on the given list of dice.

        Args:
            dice (list[int]): A list of integers representing the values of the dice.

        Returns:
            int: The total score for the given dice.
        """
        score = 0

        # Handle the case where the dice list is empty.
        if not dice:
            return score

        # Check for a straight.
        if set(dice) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:
            return 1500

        # Check for three-of-a-kind or higher.
        for value in set(dice):
            count = dice.count(value)
            if count >= 3:
                if value == 1:
                    score += 1000 if count == 3 else 1000 + (count - 3) * 100
                elif value == 5:
                    score += 500 if count == 3 else 500 + (count - 3) * 50
                else:
                    score += value * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3))
                for i in range(3):
                    dice.remove(value)

        # Add any remaining 1s or 5s.
        for value in dice:
            if value == 1:
                score += 100
            elif value == 5:
                score += 50

        # Check if there is a chance to complete a straight.
        if len(set(dice)) >= 5:
            remaining_values = set(range(1, 7)) - set(dice)
            if len(remaining_values) == 1:
                value = remaining_values.pop()
                if value == 1:
                    score += 100
                elif value == 5:
                    score += 50
                else:
                    score = 0
            elif len(remaining_values) == 2:
                score += 500

        return score
In this implementation, the calculate_score method checks for a straight and calculates the score accordingly. If the dice do not show a straight, the method checks if there is a chance to complete a straight, which is when there are at least five distinct values in the dice. If there is a chance to complete a straight, the method checks if there is one missing value, in which case the player gets one attempt to roll it. If the value appears on the next roll, the player gets the appropriate score (100 or 50 points depending on whether it is a 1 or a 5), otherwise the round is a "crap out" and the score for that round is zero. If there are two missing values, the player automatically gets 500 points for attempting to complete the straight. Note that this implementation assumes that the player can only attempt to complete the straight once per round, and that a round is a "crap out" if the attempt fails.

Three pairs are worth 1000 points, for instance 2+2, 4+4, 5+5. This rule does not count if you roll a quadruple and a pair e.g. 2+2, 2+2, 6+6 unless stated otherwise (some places have their own house rules).
Thank you for the additional rule. Here is an updated implementation of the calculate_score method that includes the three pairs rule:

python
Copy code
class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        """
        Calculate the score based on the given list of dice.

        Args:
            dice (list[int]): A list of integers representing the values of the dice.

        Returns:
            int: The total score for the given dice.
        """
        score = 0

        # Handle the case where the dice list is empty.
        if not dice:
            return score

        # Check for a straight.
        if set(dice) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:
            return 1500

        # Check for three pairs.
        value_counts = Counter(dice)
        if len(value_counts) == 3 and all(count == 2 for count in value_counts.values()):
            score += 1000
            for value in value_counts.keys():
                if value != 1 and value != 5:
                    score += value * 100

        # Check for three-of-a-kind or higher.
        for value in set(dice):
            count = dice.count(value)
            if count >= 3:
                if value == 1:
                    score += 1000 if count == 3 else 1000 + (count - 3) * 100
                elif value == 5:
                    score += 500 if count == 3 else 500 + (count - 3) * 50
                else:
                    score += value * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3))
                for i in range(3):
                    dice.remove(value)

        # Add any remaining 1s or 5s.
        for value in dice:
            if value == 1:
                score += 100
            elif value == 5:
                score += 50

        # Check if there is a chance to complete a straight.
        if len(set(dice)) >= 5:
            remaining_values = set(range(1, 7)) - set(dice)
            if len(remaining_values) == 1:
                value = remaining_values.pop()
                if value == 1:
                    score += 100
                elif value == 5:
                    score += 50
                else:
                    score = 0
            elif len(remaining_values) == 2:
                score += 500

        return score
In this implementation, the calculate_score method checks for three pairs and calculates the score accordingly. If the dice show three pairs (i.e. there are three distinct values with a count of 2 each), the player gets 1000 points plus the sum of the values of the pairs (excluding 1s and 5s, which are already accounted for in other rules). Note that this implementation assumes that the three pairs rule does not count if the player rolls a quadruple and a pair.

add static method called roll_dice to the GameLogic class to take anywhere from 1 to 6 dice and output a tuple
Sure, here is an updated implementation of the GameLogic class that includes a static method called roll_dice:
